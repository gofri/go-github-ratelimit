# go-github-ratelimit

Package go-github-ratelimit provides a http.RoundTripper implementation that handles [secondary rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#secondary-rate-limits) for the GitHub API.  
The RoundTripper waits for the secondary rate limit to finish in a blocking mode and then issues/retries requests.
It can be used with any HTTP client communicating with GitHub API.  
  
go-github-ratelimit is meant to complement [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github).  
There is no association between this repository and the go-github repository or Google.  
  
## Installation
```go get github.com/gofri/go-github-ratelimit```

## Usage Example (with go-github and [oauth2](golang.org/x/oauth2))
```go
import "github.com/google/go-github/github"
import "golang.org/x/oauth2"
import "github.com/gofri/go-github-ratelimit/github_ratelimit"

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	ts := oauth2.StaticTokenSource(
		&oauth2.Token{AccessToken: "Your Personal Access Token"},
	)
	tc := oauth2.NewClient(ctx, ts)
	rateLimiter := github_ratelimit.NewRateLimitWaiterClient(tc.Transport)
	client := github.NewClient(rateLimiter)

	// now use the client as you please
```

## Options
The RoundTripper accepts a set of optional options:
- Single Sleep Limit: limit the sleep time for a single rate limit.
- Total Sleep Limit: limit the accumulated sleep time for all rate limits.
  
The RoundTripper accepts a set of optional callbacks:
- On Limit Detected: callback for when a rate limit that requires sleeping is detected.
- On Single Limit Exceeded: callback for when a rate limit that exceeds the single sleep limit is detected.
- On Total Limit Exceeded: callback for when a rate limit that exceeds the total sleep limit is detected.
